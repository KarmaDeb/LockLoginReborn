This project is protected under RD GPL and GNU GPL 2.1

What is RD GPL?

RD GPL ( RD General Plugin License ) is a license created on January 2020 to protect GSA/RedDo resources
from copy & paste into not-allowed projects. This is because some of our resources contains code that took hours or even months to
make or work. With the idea of protecting our time, the RD GPL license was created. This is not a public license, and only RedDo
members are able to use it. As there are a lot of "RD" groups, we will provide our discord link as "group identifier". Any member
of that discord group with the role CEO or Developer can use RD GPL license freely on their projects.


Conditions

Before starting with the conditions, we must clarify when this license is applied. If specified in
README.*, the license will be applied to the whole code, otherwise, if it's not specified in README.* or it doens't exist, any class
/file/method with "Private GSA code" will be under this license. If specified in README.* and anyway, also specified separately in
the class/file/method with the "Private GSA code" comment, this will be also under GSA GPL license.
If the comment is not
literally "Private GSA code", but similar ( like "private gsa code", "gsa code" ) or contains it. Will be also took as "Private GSA
code" and the class/file/method will be also under GSA GPL license.


- By decompiling or opening a RedDo protected project/resource/object you are automatically accepting RD
GPL therms and conditions.

- To use any class/file/method protected by RedDo, you must ask permission to use it, in our discord
providing a valid email address.

- If the license gets updated, you are forced to accept new conditions or cancel the permission to use it.
You will be notified by email. If you decline, you won't be able to use the private GSA code anymore until you ask again for
permission.


- Using any class/file/method protected by RedDo, will require a link to the original author project or site.


- Modifying RedDo protected code is completely forbbiden, even with the correspondent access, this will not
be tolerated. In case you modify/use private RedDo code without a valid license, legal actions will be taken. If you have a valid
license, that license will be revoked. You can suggest a code change, without modifying the original one, but the code you suggest
to change/add will be also under GSA license even it doesn't has the private GSA comment.


- Before publishing a resource that contains private RedDo code, will require a request to the RedDo code
author.

- Using a project that contains RedDo code without a valid license and without RedDo approvation, is
forbbiden. If you found one, please stop using it, notify the project author and report it to our discord.
